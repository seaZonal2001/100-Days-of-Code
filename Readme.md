## ðŸ¤”What is 100 Days of Code?
100 Days of code is a commitment to practice DSA problems on sites like Leetcode,Hackerrank,GeeksForGeeks,Interviewbit,Prepbytes etc... and along with this participating in all upcoming coding contest like on Codeforces,Codechef,Atcoder,Hackerearth,Google Kickstart etc...

## ðŸ“‹ Whatâ€™s the plan? 
- Devoting a *minimum* of 2 hours to learn new concepts.
- And solving problems on the learnt concepts until you feel comfortable.
- Try giving every contest to track your progress.
