#### Description

You are given an array A of n integers. You can perform as many swap operations as you want. In a swap operation you can swap the elements at any two positions. 

Define score as number of indices i such that after all the operations, Ai is different from the original value of Ai. Print the maximum score possible.

#### Input Format

First line of input contains T, number of test cases.

First line of each test case contains n.

Second line contains n integers, ith integer is Ai .

 

#### Output Format

For each testcase print the maximum score possible in a new line.

#### Constraints
