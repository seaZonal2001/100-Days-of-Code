#### Description

There are N problems in a contest and the ith problem has a rating Ri. They are posted in an order top to bottom as given in input.

Each problem requires at least 1 minute to solve. You also know that if a problem P has a higher rating than a problem just above or just below it, then P must take strictly more time to solve than that problem.

Find the minimum possible time required to solve all the problems.

 

#### Input Format

First line of input contains T, number of test cases.

First line of each test case contains N.

Second line contains N integers, Ri for i from 1 to N.

 

#### Output Format

For each test case output one integer: The minimum possible time in which all problems could be solved.

#### Constraints

T ≤ 10

1 ≤ n ≤ 105

1 ≤ Ri ≤ 109

#### Sample Input 1


1

3

2 1 3

#### Sample Output 1


5

#### Note

Time for Problem 1 : 2 minutes

Time for Problem 2 : 1 minutes

Time for Problem 3 : 2 minutes

This satisfies the restriction and yields minimum time which is 2+1+2=5
