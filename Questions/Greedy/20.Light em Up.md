#### Description

There are n light bulbs in a row. Each bulb is either on or off given in input as 1 or 0 respectively.

In one operation you can select any k consecutive bulbs and flip their switches, that is, if a bulb was off it becomes on and vice versa.

Find minimum number of operations to turn all the bulbs on. If it's impossible to do so print -1.

#### Input Format

First line of input contains T, number of test cases.

First line of each test case contains n and k.

Second line contains n integers, ith integer si represents the state of the ith bulb.

 

#### Output Format

For each testcase if its possible to turn all the bulbs on, print the minimum operations required, else print -1.

##### Constraints

T ≤ 1000

0 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2*105

si = {0,1}

Sum of n over all test cases is less than 2*105.

#### Sample Input 1


1

5 2

0 1 0 1 1

#### Sample Output 1


2

#### Note

Perform the operation on the subarrays(1 indexed): [1..2] and [2..3] to get 1 1 1 1 1 .##
