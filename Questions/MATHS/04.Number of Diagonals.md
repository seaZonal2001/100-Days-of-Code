## Description

Find the number of diagonals in the Convex N-gon.

## Input Format

The first line contains T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100000), the number of test cases.
Each of the next T lines contains a positive integer N denoting the number of sides of convex polygon (3 ≤ N ≤ 109).

## Output Format

For each test case, print a single number denoting the number of diagonals in the convex N-gon. Since answer can be large, print it with modulo 1000000007.
