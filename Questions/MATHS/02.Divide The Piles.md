## Description

There are N piles of stones in front of you. ith pile contains Ai number of stones.

You want to find whether it is possible to split each pile into 1 or more piles of X (≥ 2) stones such that each splitted-pile has exactly X stones.

Note that X should be the same for each pile.

## Input Format

The first line contains T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100000), the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows:

The first line contains N, the number of piles (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000).

The second line contains N space-separated positive integers A1, A2, ..., AN (2 ≤ Ai ≤ 109).

It is guaranteed that sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 106.

## Output Format

For each test case, print "Yes" (without quotes) if it is possible to split. Otherwise, print "No" (without quotes).

## Sample Input 1


2

5

2 2 6 8 12

4

2 6 3 8

## Sample Output 1


Yes

No

## Note

#### Explanation 1:
For X = 2, you can divide each pile into smaller piles of size 2.

#### Explanation 2:
It is not possible to divide piles into smaller piles with size ≥ 2.
