## Description

Let us see the following equation,

Ax + By = C

Given three positive integers A, B and C.

You have to determine whether there exists at least one solution for some integers value of x and y where x, y may be negative or non-negative integers.

## Input Format

The first line contains T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100000), the number of test cases.

Each of the next T lines contains three positive integers A, B, C (1 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 109).

## Output Format

Print "Yes" (without quotes) if at least one solution exits, otherwise print "No" (without quotes).

## Sample Input 1
 

2

6 9 33

2 8 1

## Sample Output 1

Yes

No

## Note

#### Explanation 1:
For x = 1, y = 3, 6 * 1 + 9 * 3 = 33. The equation is satisfied for (1, 3).

#### Explanation 2:
No solution exists in this case. Observe that A and B are even numbers. So Ax + By is always even number, irrespective of the value of x and y.

But C is an odd number. So no solution exists in this case.
