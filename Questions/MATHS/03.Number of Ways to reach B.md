## Description

You have given a grid of N x M. You are initially at position A(0, 0) and you want to reach B(N, M). From the given cell (i, j), we are allowed to move to cells (i + 1, j) and (i, j + 1) only.

Find the number of different ways to reach B from A?
 


## Input Format

The first line contains T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100000), the number of test cases.

Each of the next T lines contains two positive integers N, M (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 105).

## Output Format

For each test case, print the number of ways to reach B from A. Since answer can be large, print it with modulo 1000000007.
