## Description

You have given Convex N-gon. Draw all diagonals of the convex N-gon. Suppose no three diagonals pass through a point.
Into how many parts is the N-gon divided?

## Input Format

The first line contains T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100000), the number of test cases.
Each of the next T lines contains a positive integer N denoting the number of sides of convex polygon (3 ≤ N ≤ 109).

## Output Format

For each test case, print a single number denoting the number of parts the convex N-gon divided. Since answer can be large, print it with modulo 1000000007.
