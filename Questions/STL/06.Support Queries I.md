## Description

Design a Data Structure which can support the following queries:

1 x: Add x in structure<br\>
2 x: Remove x from the structure if present in the structure. If x doesn't present in the structure, do nothing. If there are multiple occurrences of x, delete only one occurrence of x.<br\>
3 ?: Print the minimum number present in the structure. If the structure is empty, print -1.<br\>
4 ?: Print the maximum number present in the structure. If the structure is empty, print -1.<br\>
5 ?: Print the sum of all numbers present in the structure. If the structure is empty, print 0.

Initially, the structure is empty.

## Input Format

The first line of input contains Q - the number of queries.<br\>
Next, Q lines contain queries of the format specified in the statement.<br\>

## Output Format

For queries of type 3, 4 and 5, print the answer in a new line.

## Constraints

1 ≤ Q ≤ 105<br\>
0 ≤ x ≤ 109<br\>
