## Description

Bob is standing in a park at (0,0) facing north. He is given a series of instructions to move around the park. The instructions can be:

‘W’: go straight 1 unit

‘L’: turn 90 degrees left

‘R’: turn 90 degrees right

Bob has to perform the given instructions forever. If he is going in a circle forever, print ‘YES’. Otherwise, print ‘NO’ (without the quotes).

## Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains N - the length of the input string of instructions.

The second line of each test case contains one string S - the series of instructions to move around the park.

## Output Format

For each test case, print ‘YES’ if Bob is going in a circle forever. Otherwise, print ‘NO’. (without the quotes)

## Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 100

1≤ |S| ≤ 105 where |S| denotes the length of the given series of instructions.

## Sample Output 1


NO

YES

YES

Note

In the first sample test case, Bob moves north indefinitely.

In the second sample test case, Bob moves as follows: (0,0) => (-1,0) => (-1,-1) => (0,-1) => (0,0). So, Bob goes in a circle forever


In the third sample test case, Bob moves from (0,0) to (0,1) turns 180 degress and returns to (0,0). So, Bob goes in a circle forever
